# Streamlit App: Fibonacci Sequence and Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Calculator

This Streamlit app calculates the Fibonacci sequence and finds the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of two input sequences.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone  https://github.com/rajsingh162120/daa-fibo-lcs.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd your_repository
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. Select the desired option from the sidebar to calculate either the Fibonacci sequence or the LCS.

## Fibonacci Sequence

- Enter a number or select the length of the Fibonacci sequence using the slider.
- Click on "Calculate Fibonacci" to generate the Fibonacci sequence.
- The sequence and a visualization will be displayed.

## Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

- Enter two sequences in the input fields.
- Click on "Calculate LCS" to find the LCS between the two sequences.
- The LCS table and the result will be displayed.
